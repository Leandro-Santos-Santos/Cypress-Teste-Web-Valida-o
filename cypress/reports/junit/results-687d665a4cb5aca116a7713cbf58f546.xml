Common situations why this happens:
  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously
  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element

You can typically solve this by breaking up a chain. For example, rewrite:

&gt; `cy.get(&apos;button&apos;).click().should(&apos;have.class&apos;, &apos;active&apos;)`

to

&gt; `cy.get(&apos;button&apos;).as(&apos;btn&apos;).click()`
